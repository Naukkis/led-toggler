Toggle led lights via web

Play with your Rasperry Pi 3 and led lights. The leds on the breadboard can be toggled on and off via web. A standard web cam can be used to take the pictures.

What is needed: [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [gpio utility](http://wiringpi.com/the-gpio-utility/) and [venv](https://pymotw.com/3/venv/) to isolate the development environment. A server is also needed, I used Apache 2.4.
